# Challenge #5 - Swap Case

## NOTE
This file contains two methods of swapping the case, both support numbers and special characters (in addition to regular letters). In order to use the "dumb" mode, script must be called as `python3 swapper.py "String to conVerT" true` (or `TrUe`, `TRUe`, etc).

PS. Python3 is supported only, Python2 support can be used if `input()` is changed to `raw_input()`

## Overview
> Create a function called swap\_case that swaps the cases of a given string, converting all lowercase letters to uppercase and all upper to lower. 

#### Input:
A string containing only letters (no numbers or special characters)

#### Output:
The inverse casing of the given input, outputted as a string

#### Examples:
```
swap_case('hello') => 'HELLO'
swap_case('Raspberry Pi Club') => 'rASPBERRY pI cLUB'
swap_case('FoURtY twO') => 'fOurTy TWo
```
